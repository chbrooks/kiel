#### Future of Life lab

Popular culture has a huge influence on technology; we can't build what we can't
imagine. Many portrayals of AI in popular culture, such as the Terminator, are negative
or dystopian. [This article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-new-science-fiction-could-help-us-improve-ai/)
 argues that we need positive portrayals of a future with AI in order to help us
 realize those futures.

Please take a look at the [Future of Life's Worldbuilding Competition](https://futureoflife.org/project/worldbuilding-competition/)
In this competition, the FLI asked humanists, creators, and storytellers to generate
plausible, positive futures that include AI. These are definitely not utopias, but worlds
in which humanity has managed to use AI positively and avoid disaster.

 [Choose one of the finalists and explore the world they have created.](https://worldbuild.ai/winners/)

Consider the following questions for discussion:

- How does this scenario see AI evolving?
- What are the particular problems that AI is addressing here?
- What is the technological innovation or leap that's imagined?
- What are the major challenges faced, and how does humanity respond?
- In 2045, what is the state of the world? What problems have been addressed?
- What problems still remain?
- These scenarios might seem plausible, or wildly farfetched; the goal is to tell a story in which things mostly go right. How does this resonate with you?
-   Is it easy to think of a hope-filled future?
