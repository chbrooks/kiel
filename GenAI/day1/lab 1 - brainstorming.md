#### Lab 1: LLM brainstorming

The high-level idea for this workshop is to give you some resources and time to 
explore and generate ideas for projects that you might find interesting. To begin,
we'll do some brainstorming.

Using your favorite AI tool, brainstorm some ideas for how you might use AI
techniques or technologies to address a human problem. I find that giving the LLM
an initial idea and asking it to ask me questions is really helpful.

For example, here's a prompt I like to use with Claude:

```
I'm trying to develop an idea to use AI to address hunger in my city.
I would like you to ask me questions to help refine the idea. Each question
should build on the previous one. At the end, I would like to have a clear set
of next steps and a plan of action. Remember only one question at a time.
```

I then let it ask me questions; if they are going off track, you can redirect it with something like:
"Let's not worry about X right now. Ask me about Y."

You can also interrupt to ask for more details or recommendations. For example,
if the tool suggests using a database, you can ask it to compare and contrast them in a table.

The key here is that we are not using the LLM to give us answers; we're using it
to organize our own creativity.

One thing to be aware of: LLMs tend to give compliments. They will
tell you that all (or at least most) of your ideas are great,
even if they're not. You need to be your own critic here.

The LLM will ask you questions forever.
Once you have had enough or you feel like you've addressed the key issues, prompt it to summarize.

Here's what I use:

```
That's enough questions for now. Please take what we've developed and
summarize it into a plan. Be sure to capture the key ideas, challenges and opportunities.
It should contain a checklist of next steps and a list of open questions or challenges.
```
