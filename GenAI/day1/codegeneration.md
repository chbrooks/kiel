#### Lab 2. Code generation with LLMs.

In this lab, we'll get some exposure to the use of LLM-based tools for generating programs. 

One of the most impressive applications of LLMs is for the generation of code.
There are many tools currently available for generating code - GitHub CoPilot, Claude Code,
Gemini, ChatGPT, Cursor, Rucode, and more.

In this tutorial, we'll use Bolt, which has a free version and runs directly in the browser.
If you're familiar with another platform, feel free to use that.

My colleague David Wolber has created a site called peoplecode.ai that is all about
empowering novices to learn to code using low-code and no-code solutions.
To start, we'll use his tutorials on Bolt.

To begin, work through the [Trivia App](https://www.peoplecode.ai/bolt-trivia-app) on the
peoplecode site. This will get you started with Bolt and show you how to use it to generate an app.

Depending on your background, this might be straightforward or it might be challenging.
If you're new to all of this, take it slow. See if you can make changes to the look and feel of the app, and
get comfortable with this idea of using natural language to instruct the computer.
Experiment with different sorts of prompts to see what works. Try single instructions and
batches. Vary the level of detail.

Once you're comfortable with this, try a more complex app. The [mood recorder](https://www.peoplecode.ai/bolt-mood-recorder)
tutorial shows you how to use a database within a Bolt-generated app, which is very
helpful.

If you're not excited about the mood generator, some other easy-to-implement
ideas are:

    - A choose your own adventure game
    - Wordle
    - D&D character generator
    - Music manager
    - Fitness tracker

As you're working on this, think about the ideas you brainstormed earlier.
Could you use this approach to address them?

You might find that your initial idea is way too large for this approach.
Think about how you can decompose it into smaller pieces.

Tomorrow we'll dig into this more.
