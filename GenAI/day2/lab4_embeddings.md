#### Lab 4: Embeddings

Embeddings are at the heart of many modern machine learning and generative AI tools.
They allow us to efficiently work with large, high-dimensional images, remove
excess information that might lead to errors or overfitting, and map inputs
between modalities, such as text and sound.

[This set of exercises from Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/embeddings/)
will give you a nice introduction to embeddings. It's designed in such a way as to
allow students of different levels to engage with it.

If you are new to machine learning, work your way through the exercises and try
to focus on the big picture. Don't get too wrapped up in the terminology or all
the details. The goal is to understand what an embedding is and why they're helpful.

If you have some experience, go deeper! Look at other datasets in the embedding projector to see how they
behave. Go back to Hugging Face and see what embedding models are available.
