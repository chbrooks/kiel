#### Lab 6: Integrating External Sources

I've assembled a few resources here to help you learn
about more advanced LLM augmentations. These are not quite as
user-friendly as the earlier labs, and require a little more coding. All of this
stuff is super new!

If you're an experienced programmer, pick out one or more of these,
work through it, and then think about how you might use this in your project.

If you're a newcomer, you might want to just read through one or more of them.
The Vertex AI toolkit also lets you work with these concepts; it's a little rough around the edges,
though.
